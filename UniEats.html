            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>UniEats is a food delivery app designed specifically for university 
                students and faculty, enabling them to order meals from their on-campus
                cafeterias and have them delivered directly to their dorms, classrooms, or 
                common areas. The project aimed to streamline the ordering and delivery 
                process, allowing students to focus more on their academic and social 
                activities rather than worrying about meal planning and long wait times at 
                the cafeteria.</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The challenge was to create an intuitive user experience that not only made it easy for users to browse and purchase clothing but also highlighted the local fashion brands and their unique products.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                For the UniEats project, the design process began with discovery, where I conducted user interviews 
                with students and campus vendors to identify pain points, such as difficulty locating eateries and 
                inefficient order tracking. This was followed by defining the problem with a clear problem statement 
                and the creation of personas and user journey maps to align stakeholders. During the ideation phase, 
                I brainstormed solutions like location-based eatery search, real-time order tracking, and simplified 
                payment systems, prioritizing features using a MoSCoW matrix. I then moved into design, creating 
                low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, ensuring accessibility and a 
                student-friendly aesthetic. These designs were refined through team critiques and validated in 
                usability testing with students and vendors, leading to iterative improvements such as simplifying 
                checkout flows. In the development handoff, I provided annotated prototypes and collaborated with 
                developers to ensure accurate implementation. Post-launch, I supported the rollout with onboarding
                screens and promotional materials, gathered feedback through surveys and analytics, and introduced 
                iterative enhancements like group ordering and personalized recommendations to improve the platform
                further.
