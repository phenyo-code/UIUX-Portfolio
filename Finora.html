            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>As financial services become more digital, users in urban areas demand seamless, fast, and 
                secure digital banking experiences. Traditional banking apps often lack integration with 
                modern payment systems and do not provide personalized tools to manage finances effectively. 
                VirtualBank was created to address these pain points.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>For the Finora project, the design process began with discovery, where I conducted extensive research 
            into digital banking trends and user needs, including interviews with potential users to identify pain 
            points such as difficulty navigating complex interfaces and lack of responsive design. During the define 
            phase, I crafted a problem statement and developed user personas, focusing on tech-savvy individuals and 
            small business owners, while mapping out user journeys to pinpoint areas for improvement. In the ideation 
            phase, I proposed solutions like seamless navigation, intuitive dashboards, and adaptive designs to ensure 
            usability across devices, prioritizing features with a MoSCoW matrix. Moving into design, I created 
            low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes using Figma, emphasizing a professional yet approachable
             aesthetic with clean layouts and accessible typography. These designs were validated through usability 
             testing, where participants provided feedback on navigation and feature clarity, leading to iterative improvements, such as refining menu structures and enhancing visual hierarchy. During the development handoff, I provided detailed design specifications, collaborated with developers during sprints, and resolved queries to maintain design integrity. Post-launch, I supported user onboarding with walkthroughs and tooltips, collected user feedback, and implemented iterative updates like customizable dashboards and enhanced data visualization features to elevate the user experience further.
